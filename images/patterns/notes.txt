Initially this directory was about just putting random data into and image. I
tried it without success. Some data I found would break an image. It would still
be able to be open, but the image would not "progress". So I have re-evaluated
my approach and will try and create images with patterns of text. So I will have
a block a text to repeat until the image is finished. I will start out with a
sonnet by Shakespeare.
