Brief summary:
My goal is to try and figure out more in depth about the jpg file format and how
I can databend it. Hopefully with some predictable results. If I open an image
and start randomly changing bytes the results often come out somehow similar.
Bright saturated colours, horizontal lines, compression artefacts, and
repetitions of the image content amongst other things.

Databending:
The kind of databending I want to do is by opening the images in a hex editor
and edit the ASCII text. I want to see if there are ways that I can affect the
image in a predictable way by finding out more about how the format works. To do
that I will have to do some experiments.

Method and Experiments:
My method will include finding four images, two that are different, but the same
resolution, and two more that are in different sizes. To sum up, four images,
three resolutions. These will all be scrubbed of data in a hex editor, down to
the size that removal of another byte will cause the file to break. By only
keeping the header of the original images I hope I will have a more common
ground to start from. The source for my images will be NASA since their images
are licensed under the Creative Commons.

So first of all I will scrub the data from the images. This turns the images
into grey canvases for the new data to be reapplied. Having done that I will
start writing in new data in the form of ASCII in a hex editor. With the text
that I write I will see if I can find patterns in how the computer interprets
the data I write into the image. An easy experiment will be to discover how many
characters make a line, I expect this to be dependent on resolution. After that
it will be to see if I can predict the colour as well. These things will be
tried out on all four images at the same time so that I will be able to
continuously compare the results of my changes.
