## Artistic Research
I am a student at the Danish School of Performing Arts. On this page I will be
documenting my artistic research that is a part of my masters degree. The nature
of the content in this depository will most likely change a lot as time passes.
My older work will not be taken down but merely moved into a separate archive
folder.

### Painting With Data
What I am working with right now is figuring out different ways of painting with
data. By opening different kinds of files (movies, sound, and image) in hex
editors, I can write new data into them and change the way the computer will
interpret them on a fundamental level. I want to try and figure out if there are
predictable ways of bending the data to have more predictable results. At the
end I hope that this will lead me to a method where I can perform live with
image manipulation through text.
