## Artistic Research
I am a student at the Danish School of Performing Arts. On this page I will be
documenting my artistic research that is a part of my masters degree. The nature
of the content in this depository will most likely change a lot as time passes.
My older work will not be taken down but merely moved into a separate archive
folder.

### Painting With Data
My current project is called Painting With Data. I got the idea by
experimenting with a technique called databending. Databending is about opening
images, videos, and audio files in software they are not meant to be opened in,
and then changed. I have chosen to work with the jpeg file format, and to bend
it by opening it in a hex editor. This was to narrow the scope of the project
down.

Initially the plan was to find a way to databend files as a way of creating
live visuals. So the start of the project also included to find software that
could help with the live performance as well. These experiments were not
fruitful and before I got really into it, the corona lockdown meant that my
possibilities of trying this live was cut woefully short. Instead the project
became more focused on the abilities and possibilities of the jpeg format with a
hope of finding more predictable ways of bending it.

Another thing that has been apart of the project is the wish for it to be open
source and this is also why I chose to host my work on Github. There I also
licensed it under the GPL-3.0, a hard copyleft licence, so that it is available
for others to work on without possible legal ramifications. This is also
important since apart of what I am trying is to make people look at their
computer in a different way.

The way I chose to do that was through bending the jpeg-format as previously
mentioned. What I am doing is using human readable text inside an image's source
data to create a new image that is a computer's interpretation of the human
readable text into something that makes sense for the machine. So much of
written down thoughts I have had are hidden inside of images for others to
explore.

### Exploration Guide
To better getter grasp my project I would recommend anyone who wants to learn
more about my project to start of with opening the folders numbered with 1, then
2 and so on and so on. To be blunt, first the texts and the folder there. Then
images and the folders therein. Lastly one could have a look at the archive,
though that is not that important nor interesting. This would let you first read
some of my thoughts, and then see the works I have made based on my ideas. And
if interesting, lastly see the previous works of the project in the archive.

If you are more interested in cherry picking, the pdf folder and the image
folders are the ones that are most pertinent to the project.

### Contributions
I hope that my work will inspire curiosity in others and interest in
collaboration on discovering more about the way the jpeg format works.
