# Artistic Research
Welcome to my page sharing my artistic research that is a part of my master's
degree at the Danish National School of Performing Arts. My artistic research
right now is looking in to how humans and computers interact and how this shapes
us in the creative fields. To learn more about my project follow the steps
listed below.

## How to Acess My Project Description
Since I am looking into how humans and machines interact I wanted my project
description to highlight this. Therefore my project description are not written
in a text format, but an image format. To be able to read it the images need to
be opened as text documents. I will explain how next.

### Download
##### Download as Zip
In the depository there is a green button that says **Clone or Downdload**.
Clicking on this gives the opportunity to download the files as a zip. Download
and unzip in folder of your choosing.

##### Download Through CLI `git`

###### Linux
Open your terminal and install the `git` package from your distribution's
repository. For example on an Arch based system run the command `sudo pacman -S
git`. Having made sure that `git` is installed, run this command: `git clone
https://github.com/aa-83/artistic_research.git` to download the files.

###### MacOS
To install git on you terminal follow these guides first, [How to install command line tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)
and then [how to install Homebrew](http://osxdaily.com/2018/03/07/how-install-homebrew-mac-os/). This should not take more than five minutes.
When this is done type in your terminal

```
brew install git
git clone https://github.com/aa-83/artistic_research.git
```

###### Microsoft Windows
Description in Progress

##### Download Individual Files
There is also the option of clicking on the .jpg-file and downloading the file
from the webpage it leads to.

### How to Read the Images
To be able read the .jpgs they have to be opened in a text editor, hex editor
with ASCII support, or a word processor.

Examples of hex editors:
- Bless (Linux)
- Hexedit (MacOS)
- WinHex (Windows)

Examples of text editors:
- Vim
- Emacs
- Notepad (Windows)
- TextEdir (MacOS)

Examples of word processors:
- Microsoft Word
- OpenOffice Writer
- LibreOffice Writer
- Apple Pages (MacOS)
- Google Docs

Any of these programs should be able to open the images I have made. Inside the
images there is a lot of text. The reason is because if not, the images would
mostly be a grey solid. To separate between the repetitions I have but up these
signs /* */ with the text being inbetween these signs. Also since images are not
supposed to be opened in text programs, the formatting will be weird, and it is
often necessary to scroll horizontally for text editors and vertically for word
processors.
