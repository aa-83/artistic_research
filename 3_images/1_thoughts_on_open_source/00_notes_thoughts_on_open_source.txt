This directory was less of an experiment, but more a way of me to express some
of my thoughts regarding the open source movement. The exercise I created was to
write until the text had created one full line of pixels. As one line is made, I
close the document, copy it, and continue typing in the new image. An idea that
ocurred to me while typing the images. As I write the images, the image starts
to fill. What I am curious about is whether it is possible to only keep the new
text and remove what is a part of the others, while maintaining the postion
without the previous data making the foundation for the placement of the pixels
in the image. In the end I hope that this folder will consist of images that
each only holds on line of pixels, and when laid all out next to eachother they
would form a complete image. If this is doable, the next step would be to see if
these images could be combined into an animation.
