In this directory I will try and experiment metadata manipulation. The first
thing I did was to make to copies of the template I have in this directory. One
is en exact copy, in the other I used a program called exiv2 and used it to
erase the metadata in the other copy. Opening the images in a previewer I
noticed that the template and exact copy still have the thumbnail of the
origianl image, the copy with no metada has no thumbnail. When I open them
though, they all look the same. Empty grey slates. I will try to add the exact
same content to both images and see if the metadata manipulation will give
different results.

I wrote some text and put it into both pictures, and rather disappointingly,
they look just the same. So just removing metadata does not remove any important
metadata settings. Probably the only noteworthy thing that was removed was the
thumbnail. The next step will be to see if I can add something to metadata that
will lead to these files behaving differently.
