# Artistic Research
Welcome to my page sharing my artistic research that is a part of my master's
degree at the Danish National School of Performing Arts. My artistic research
right now is looking in to how humans and computers interact and how this shapes
us in the creative fields. To learn more about my project follow the steps
listed below. If you came here by following my QR-code, I would reccomend you to

## How to Acess My Project Description
Since I am looking into how humans and machines interact I wanted my project
description to highlight this. Therefore my project description are not written
in a text format, but an image format. To be able to read it the images need to
be opened as text documents. When the files are downloaded enter the Images
folder and read the HOWTO.txt for the instructions on how to read them. If you
are unfamiliar with `git` or github, pleas read the HOWTODOWNLOAD.txt.
